Modification history

***** as of Jan 6, 2019

1. Audiosamples now stored in union 'audio'. Union is declared in audio.h

2. Function Codec_WriteRegister in audio.c enhanced to support 9 bit CODEC register values

3. Volume control removed from ISR, instead support for CODEC line in and head phone amplifier added.
   Amps are controlled by means of slider 4 and 5

4. DMA related stuff in audio.h moved to dstc.c to stop Eclipse syntax complain about unresolved symbols

5. Project structure for includes / libs modified to reflect the different sources the software is coming from. 
   Path: FM4_plugin_UART2\system\include\... Include paths in project settings must be modifed accordingly.

6. In several files Prototypes added to stop compiler warnings

7. FM4_slider_interface.c modified to support german locale (',' as separator). Renamed to FM4_slider_interface_comma.c

All modifications are documented in the change history of the source code.


***** as of Jan 13, 2019

The following modifications were needed to allow code execution from internal SRAM.
SRAM execution should be the preferred method since the flash data retention decreases with increasing
number of programming cycles.

1. s6e2cc_ram.ld:	Linker script exchanged with latest version from PDL 2.1.0: 's6e2cca_ram.ld'. 
   					's6e2cca_ram.ld' is the correct version for the MCU SKU used on the FM4 pioneer kit.
   					Update poject properties under C/C++ Build/Settings/Cross ARM C++ Linker/General to reflect 
   					the new script name.

2. startup_s6e2cc.S: 
	2.1.	Startup code exchanged with latest version from PDL 2.1.0.
   			This was necessary due to inconsistent symbol names after the exchange of the linker script file.
   	2.2.	Code added to allow relocation of the interrupt vector table to SRAM (location: Immediately before jump to main)
			ldr r0, =0xE000ED08	// VTOR register in SCB
  			ldr r1, =__FM_interrupt_vector_cortex_m
  			str r1, [r0]
  			
4. dstc.c:	DSTC_COMP_IRQHandler renamed to DSTC_HW_IRQHandler to be in sync with interrupt vector table 
 			as defined in startup code taken from PDL 2.1.0
 				 
5. i2s.c: 	PRGCRC_I2S_IRQHandler renamed to PCRC_I2S0_1_IRQHandler to be in sync with interrupt vector table 
			as defined in startup code taken from PDL 2.1.0
			
6. pdl.h:	Interrupt names sync'ed with startup code definitions

7. In Debug Configuration, tab 'Startup', button 'RAM application' must be checked to enable debugging from RAM

Note: 
To change to rom based execution change the linker script configuration as described in (1) to 's6e2cca_r0m.ld'
and uncheck the radion button 'RAM application' in the debug confguration


***** as of Jan 15, 2019

1. loop_dma.c:  Line in and head phone out volume control through slider app added

2. dstc.c, dst.h: Buffer declarations moved from dstc.c to dstc.h


***** as of Jan 17, 2019

1. i2s_init:	Interrupt Control Register transmit fifo interrupt (TXFIM) disabled, receive fifo (RXFIM) interrupt enabled.
				Neccessary to avoid double interrupts if audio samples are dropped e.g. in case of downsampling

2. aliasing_intr.c: More generalized version

3. CMSIS: Content in folder system\include\cmsis replaced by PDL 2.1.0 cmsis folder

4. All src files: 	'oldPvals5 = FM4_GUI.P_vals[5]' and 'oldPvals4 = FM4_GUI.P_vals[4]' moved to the end of the
					while(1) loop.
					
5. loop_dma.c: Slider update had to be moved into while loop for buffer full / empty to get it working


**** as of Jan 25, 2019

1. IIR_direct_intr: Added and enhanced (new function to calculate the filter coeficcients) 

2. aliasing_intr: Variable down_sample changed to filter

3. i2s.c: 	I2S module initialization corrected. 
			FM4_I2S0->CNTREG_f.OVHD  = 0 -> FM4_I2S0->CNTREG_f.OVHD  = 96
			FM4_I2S0->CNTREG_f.FSLN  = TRUE -> FM4_I2S0->CNTREG_f.FSLN  = FALSE

*					 Heap_Size 	0x00020000 -> 0x00000400



			
 Notes: 
 Sometimes, depending on code size or arrangement the debugger will not start in RAM debug mode. The reason is unknown. 
 As a workaround it may help to modify the debug configuration: In tab 'Startup' check the radio button 
 'Set program counter to (hex)' with address '1FFD0240'.
